# Code Overview for `rule.py`

## **Overview**

This module defines the `Rule` class, which encapsulates the conditions, actions, and constraints that define a rule in an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) system. Additionally, the `RuleManager` class is responsible for managing multiple rules, parsing them from string representations, evaluating them, and serializing or deserializing rule data.

## Key Features

* **Rule Class**:

  * Represents an ABAC rule with subject conditions, resource conditions, allowed actions, and constraints.
  * Provides methods for evaluating whether a rule is satisfied based on the user, resource, and action.
* **RuleManager Class**:

  * Manages a collection of rules.
  * Provides methods for parsing rule definitions, serializing, and deserializing rules, as well as retrieving rules by index.

## Imports

* **`pickle`**: For serializing and deserializing rule data.

## Classes

### **Rule**

A class that represents a single ABAC rule with conditions, actions, and constraints.

#### **Constructor**

```python
def __init__(self, sub_cond, res_cond, acts, cons):
```

* **Parameters**:

  * `sub_cond` (list): A list of tuples representing subject conditions (e.g., (`attr`, `op`, `value`)).
  * `res_cond` (list): A list of tuples representing resource conditions (e.g., (`attr`, `op`, `value`)).
  * `acts` (set): A set of actions allowed by the rule.
  * `cons` (list): A list of constraints (e.g., (`left_attr`, `op`, `right_attr`)).

#### **Methods**

##### `get_attributes()`

```python
def get_attributes(self):
```

* **Returns**:

  * A dictionary containing sets of user attributes, resource attributes, actions, and constraints used in the rule.
  * The dictionary has the following structure:

    * `"user"`: Set of user attributes.
    * `"resource"`: Set of resource attributes.
    * `"acts"`: Set of actions.
    * `"constraints"`: Set of constraints.

##### `evaluate(user, resource, action)`

```python
def evaluate(self, user, resource, action):
```

* **Parameters**:

  * `user` (User): The user object to evaluate against.
  * `resource` (Resource): The resource object to evaluate against.
  * `action` (str): The action the user wants to perform.
* **Returns**:

  * `True` if the rule is satisfied (i.e., if the action is allowed, and the conditions and constraints hold).
  * `False` otherwise.

  The evaluation checks:

  * If the action is allowed.
  * If the subject conditions for the user hold.
  * If the resource conditions for the resource hold.
  * If the constraints on the user and resource are satisfied.

### **RuleManager**

A class for managing a collection of `Rule` objects.

#### **Constructor**

```python
def __init__(self):
```

* **Behavior**:

  * Initializes an empty list of rules.

#### **Methods**

##### `parse_rule(line)`

```python
def parse_rule(self, line):
```

* **Parameters**:

  * `line` (str): A string containing a rule definition to be parsed.
* **Returns**:

  * A `Rule` object representing the parsed rule.
* **Behavior**:

  * Parses a rule from a string representation and adds it to the `rules` list.

##### `get_rule(index)`

```python
def get_rule(self, index):
```

* **Parameters**:

  * `index` (int): The index of the rule to retrieve.
* **Returns**:

  * The `Rule` object at the specified index.
* **Raises**:

  * `IndexError` if the index is out of range.

##### `serialize(file_path)`

```python
def serialize(self, file_path):
```

* **Parameters**:

  * `file_path` (str): The path to the file where the rules will be saved.
* **Behavior**:

  * Serializes the `rules` list and saves it to a file using `pickle`.

##### `deserialize(file_path)`

```python
def deserialize(self, file_path):
```

* **Parameters**:

  * `file_path` (str): The path to the file containing serialized rule data.
* **Behavior**:

  * Loads the serialized rule data from a file and populates the `rules` list.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Rule and Evaluating it

```python
rule = Rule(
    sub_cond=[("role", "=", "admin"), ("age", ">", 18)],
    res_cond=[("resource_type", "=", "database")],
    acts={"read", "write"},
    cons=[("age", ">", "min_age")]
)

# Evaluate the rule
result = rule.evaluate(user, resource, "read")
print(result)  # True if the rule is satisfied, False otherwise
```

### Managing Rules with RuleManager

```python
rule_manager = RuleManager()
rule_manager.parse_rule("subjectCond(role=admin, age>18); resourceCond(type=database); actions={read, write}; constraints=(age>min_age)")

# Serialize rules to a file
rule_manager.serialize("rules.pkl")

# Deserialize rules from a file
rule_manager.deserialize("rules.pkl")

# Retrieve a rule by index
retrieved_rule = rule_manager.get_rule(0)
print(retrieved_rule.get_attributes())
```

## **Serialization and Deserialization Example**

### **Serialize Rules to File**

```python
rule_manager = RuleManager()
rule_manager.parse_rule("subjectCond(role=admin, age>18); resourceCond(type=database); actions={read, write}; constraints=(age>min_age)")
rule_manager.serialize("rules.pkl")
```

### **Deserialize Rules from File**

```python
rule_manager = RuleManager()
rule_manager.deserialize("rules.pkl")
rule = rule_manager.get_rule(0)
print(rule.get_attributes())
```

## **Error Handling**

* **`IndexError`**: Raised when attempting to retrieve a rule with an invalid index using `get_rule`.
* **`FileNotFoundError`**: May be raised during deserialization if the specified file does not exist or is corrupted.
